This is a demo project, which use a lot of launchpad and boosterpack devices to create simple electronic lock.

We use:

TIVA-C and CC110L Air Boosterpack as a door actuator

MSP430F5529 and CC110L air boosterpack as a rf charm

and CC3200-launchpad and CC110L Air boosterpack as a Wi-Fi router.

If there is some alert situation with the door, wqe use tembo and nexmo to send a message
